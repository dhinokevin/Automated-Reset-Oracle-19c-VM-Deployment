1. Using Postman to Send the HTTP Request
Postman is a popular API testing tool that allows you to easily send HTTP requests and view responses. Here's how you can use it:

Step 1: Open Postman
Download and install Postman if you haven't already: Download Postman.
Step 2: Configure the Request in Postman
Set the HTTP method:

In the dropdown menu on the left side of the URL bar, select POST.
Enter the URL:

In the URL bar, enter the endpoint for triggering the reset. For example:
bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/start-database-reset
This is assuming that your API is running locally on port 8080. If it's hosted elsewhere, use the appropriate URL.
Set the Request Body:

Click on the Body tab in Postman.

Select raw and then choose JSON from the dropdown list on the right.

Paste the following JSON into the body section:

json
Copy code
{
    "azure_connection_string": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myaccount;AccountKey=mykey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
    "container_name": "backup-container",
    "blob_name": "backup.dmp",
    "db_connection_string": "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:ORCL",
    "db_username": "SYSTEM",
    "db_password": "Admin1234",
    "import_parameters": "remap_schema=old_schema:new_schema"
}
Step 3: Send the Request
Click the Send button to submit the request.
Step 4: View the Response
Postman will display the response from the server in the lower section of the window.
If everything is configured properly, you will see a response like:
json
Copy code
{
    "status": "Started",
    "message": "Database reset process initiated. You will receive updates via Microsoft Teams."
}
If there are any issues with the request, Postman will show you the error message and status code.

2. Using cURL to Send the HTTP Request
You can also use cURL, which is a command-line tool for transferring data via URLs.

Step 1: Open your terminal or command prompt
If you are on Windows, open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
If you are on Mac/Linux, open Terminal.
Step 2: Send the Request Using cURL
Run the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/start-database-reset \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "azure_connection_string": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myaccount;AccountKey=mykey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
           "container_name": "backup-container",
           "blob_name": "backup.dmp",
           "db_connection_string": "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:ORCL",
           "db_username": "SYSTEM",
           "db_password": "Admin1234",
           "import_parameters": "remap_schema=old_schema:new_schema"
         }'
Step 3: View the Response
After running the command, you should see a response similar to:

json
Copy code
{
    "status": "Started",
    "message": "Database reset process initiated. You will receive updates via Microsoft Teams."
}
If thereâ€™s an error, the response will show the error message and HTTP status code.
